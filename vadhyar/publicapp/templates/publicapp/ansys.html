                      <h2>About The Course</h2>
                      <p><h3>Ansys software is mainly used to design products and semiconductors. This software creates the simulated computerized structures, electronics, machine components, to mark out their strength, toughness, elasticity, temperature distribution, electromagnetism, fluid flow, and other attributes. Ansys is used to determine how a product will function, without conducting any tests. Most Ansys works are carried out by the company's main product, Ansys Workbench Software. Ansys helps to make larger structures into smaller components. A user may ask to start the software by defining the dimensions of the object, then by final Ansys software will analyze the movement, fatigue, fractures, fluid flow, temperature distribution, electromagnetic efficiency, and other effects over time. The software also contains tools for data management and backup, academic research, and teaching.

								<p class="testimonials_text">"2 friends along with me enrolled for digital marketing course here. After 2/3 classes I felt not satisfied with the tutor and teaching. I addressed the issue to General manager Sandeep sir . He told me not to worry and within few weeks he appointed two well trained staff for us, Linta miss and Arun sir. They had really great method of teaching and showed me career path and possibilities. Placement assistance was  given and  amrutha (HR) helped me throughout the process . I got selected as Digital Marketing Executive at a Kenzine Garden centre and I am really excited to pursue my new journey. Had a great experience all together. Friendly approach towards the students make them stand out from other training centre's. My two other friends are also satisfied by the experience. At my first impression I felt the place is not that good and later I realised that "a big business starts small". All the best to Sandeep sir a really talented business man. Amidst the COVID -19 chaos their efforts to educate students has really impressed me."</p>
