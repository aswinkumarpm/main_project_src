								<p class="testimonials_text">"2 friends along with me enrolled for digital marketing course here. After 2/3 classes I felt not satisfied with the tutor and teaching. I addressed the issue to General manager Sandeep sir . He told me not to worry and within few weeks he appointed two well trained staff for us, Linta miss and Arun sir. They had really great method of teaching and showed me career path and possibilities. Placement assistance was  given and  amrutha (HR) helped me throughout the process . I got selected as Digital Marketing Executive at a Kenzine Garden centre and I am really excited to pursue my new journey. Had a great experience all together. Friendly approach towards the students make them stand out from other training centre's. My two other friends are also satisfied by the experience. At my first impression I felt the place is not that good and later I realised that "a big business starts small". All the best to Sandeep sir a really talented business man. Amidst the COVID -19 chaos their efforts to educate students has really impressed me."</p>
