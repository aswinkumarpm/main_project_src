                      <p><h3>The objective of the course is to equip students to use SketchUp for the model building to create ideas and present them on time, Use v-ray for SketchUp to create renderings with proper lighting and photorealism. And learn the methods to use SketchUp layouts to design presentations including the renders, floor plans, sections and elevations in an arranged way.
                        SketchUp enables designers and architects to design shapes and lines. It allows moving the surfaces back and forth for transforming them into 3D forms fast and correctly. With the SketchUp, you will be capable of playing and creating anything that you like or desire. The ability of SketchUp is spread to the representations of the model using LayOut. The option of LayOut in SketchUp helps in applying drawing scales, adding model views to pages, and insert graphics, callouts, and dimensions. The corrections made to the SketchUp model displays automatically in LayOut which helps to save time, effort, and energy.

								<p class="testimonials_text">"2 friends along with me enrolled for digital marketing course here. After 2/3 classes I felt not satisfied with the tutor and teaching. I addressed the issue to General manager Sandeep sir . He told me not to worry and within few weeks he appointed two well trained staff for us, Linta miss and Arun sir. They had really great method of teaching and showed me career path and possibilities. Placement assistance was  given and  amrutha (HR) helped me throughout the process . I got selected as Digital Marketing Executive at a Kenzine Garden centre and I am really excited to pursue my new journey. Had a great experience all together. Friendly approach towards the students make them stand out from other training centre's. My two other friends are also satisfied by the experience. At my first impression I felt the place is not that good and later I realised that "a big business starts small". All the best to Sandeep sir a really talented business man. Amidst the COVID -19 chaos their efforts to educate students has really impressed me."</p>
